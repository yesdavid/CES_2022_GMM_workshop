### Overview of contents and how to reproduce:

This repository contains the data collaboratively collected and prepared in the workshop "Cultural evolutionary tools for stone tool shape analysis: Geometric morphometrics and Bayesian phylogenetics" hosted at the Aarhus Institute for Advanced Studies, in Aarhus, Denmark in September 2022. The dataset present in the folder `database` contains outlines together with their associated metadata of 646 artefacts collected from eight different countries, spanning a timeframe of ~18.000 to 500 years BP. For further information, please refer to the Supplementary Informations. 

After downloading, the results can be reproduced using `CES_2022_workshop.Rproj` and the existing folder structure. The required packages and their versions which have been used in this study are listed below and in the `DESCRIPTION`-file. All analyses and visualisations presented in this paper were prepared in R 4.2.1 under Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (64-bit).

### Required R-packages and their versions:

The R code provides an example on how to load, inspect, and plot different aspects of the data. It requires the following R-packages: dplyr (>= 1.0.8), ggplot2 (>= 3.4.0), ggthemes (>= 4.2.4), magrittr (>= 2.0.2), Momocs (>= 1.3.0), outlineR (>= 0.1.0), raster (>= 3.5-15), readr (>= 2.1.2), remotes (>= 2.4.2), rgeos (>= 0.5-9), rworldmap (>= 1.3-6), sp (>= 1.4-6).
